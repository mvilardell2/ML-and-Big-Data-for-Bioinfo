# Machine Learning and Big Data for bioinformatics

This repository contains all the code regarding the MOOC course in machine learning and Big Data for Bioinformatics given by Universidad de Granada. The code is in a jupyter notebook format, which employs two programming languages: Python and R. 


### Bioinformatics for omics analysis: 
This module describes how to obtain and prepare data from TCGA (TCGAbiolinks), and all the downstream analysis: 
- Preprocess data and normalization
- Data analysis: heatmaps, PCA, differential expression analysis
- Functional analysis: Gene set enrichment analysis using GO and KEGG terms.
